Welcome to **Sweets Swap**, a candy-crushing game built with React, @redux-toolkit, and react-router-dom. This game features a dynamic gameplay experience with candies falling due to gravity after explosions and a customizable board size. 

This Website is deployed on Vercel, [Play Game](https://sweetswap-nu.vercel.app/). 🚀

 

## ⭐Features

1.  **Redux Store Integration**: The application is built with a Redux store, providing a centralized state management system for a seamless gaming experience. 
    
3.  **Variable Board Size**: Customize your gaming experience by adjusting the board size according to your preference.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Implementing Gravity for Candies

One of the challenges encountered during development was implementing gravity for candies to fall after explosions. This required careful consideration of the game's physics to create a visually appealing candy fall effect.

### 2. Drag and Drop Feature

Implementing the Drag and Drop feature presented its own set of challenges. Ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience while handling the complexities of dragging and dropping candies on the board required meticulous attention to detail.
